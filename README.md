# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS ON FACTORS INFLUENCING HUMAN LIFE EXPECTANCY

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.

## OBJECTIVE
> _To analyse the predicting variables which are actually affecting life expectancy._
Our major objective here is to study the important factors affecting the life expectancies of various countries and get insights from the data.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Life expectancy is the key metric for assessing population health. The project focuses on all the countries to determine the predicting factor which is contributing to the lower value of life expectancy. This will help in suggesting countries, which area should be given importance in order to efficiently improve the life expectancy of their population.
It relies on Exploratory Data Analysis for the accuracy of the life expectancy data for further study, which includes techniques like data extraction, data cleaning, and selecting major features from the data. The missing values are imputed wherein with a large dataset, missingness of up to 40% may even be acceptable.
Among all categories of health-related factors, those critical factors which are more representative of chosen affecting life expectancy will be segregated using feature selection. The resultant is visualized using various visualization techniques, depicting scatteredness, correlation, etc. among each other.
